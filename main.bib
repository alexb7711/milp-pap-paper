  abstract = {Because of zero emissions and other social and economic benefits, electric vehicles (EVs) are currently being introduced in more and more transit agencies around the world. One of the most challenging tasks involves efficiently scheduling a set of EVs considering the limited driving range and charging requirement constraints. This study examines the battery-electric transit vehicle scheduling problem (BET-VSP) with stationary battery chargers installed at transit terminal stations. Two equivalent versions of mathematical formulations of the problem are provided. The first formulation is based on the deficit function theory, and the second formulation is an equivalent bi-objective integer programming model. The first objective of the math-programming optimization is to minimize the total number of EVs required, while the second objective is to minimize the total number of battery chargers required. To solve this bi-objective BET-VSP, two solution methods are developed. First, a lexicographic method-based two-stage construction-and-optimization solution procedure is proposed. Second, an adjusted max-flow solution method is developed. Three numerical examples are used as an expository device to illustrate the solution methods, together with a real-life case study in Singapore. The results demonstrate that the proposed math-programming models and solution methods are effective and have the potential to be applied in solving large-scale real-world BET-VSPs.},

  abstract = {Electric transit buses have been recognized as an important alternative to diesel buses with many environmental benefits. Electric buses employing lithium titanate batteries can provide uninterrupted transit service thanks to their ability of fast charging. However, fast charging may result in high demand charges which will increase the fuel costs thereby limiting the electric bus market penetration. In this paper, we simulated daily charging patterns and demand charges of a fleet of electric buses in Tallahassee, Florida and identified an optimal charging strategy to minimize demand charges. It was found that by using a charging threshold of 60–64%, a $160,848 total saving in electricity cost can be achieved for a five electric bus fleet, comparing to a charging threshold of 0–28%. In addition, the impact of fleet sizes on the fuel cost was investigated. Fleets of 4 and 12 buses will achieve the lowest cost per mile driven when one fast charger is installed.},

The model is demonstrated using a real-world transit network based in Davis, California. The results showed that range anxiety can be eliminated by adopting certain recharging strategies. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the model could provide transit agencies with comprehensive guidance on the utilization of electric buses and development of a fast charging system. The comparative analyses showed that it was more economical and environmentally friendly to utilize electric buses than diesel buses.},
